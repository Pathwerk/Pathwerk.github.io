          <h2>What this project is</h2>
              <p class = content>Draw and Play is an IOS targetted App designed to allow the user to turn their drawings into games. It uses OpenCV image processing to convert images into a 2d game scene that can be played with inside a simple
              engine. For more information please contact the team members directly</p>
          <h2>What I have done</h2>
              <p class = content>I suppouse the best name for my role in this project would be researcher. I was the one that had originally researched how to use OpenCV. I also helped
              link toghter the game engine and the image processor. I also created a matrix conversion that turned the image into usable binary so that information could be more easily transferrred between the two segments of the app</p>
